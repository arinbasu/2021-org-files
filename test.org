* A brief tutorial on org-mode: introduction

  Org-mode is a great writing and content authoring and thinking tool for emacs. In order to use org-mode, it is best to first install Emacs and then use org-mode. Use org-mode as an outliner. Use org-mode in conjunction with bibtex to write academic documents that can then be exported to various formats after parsing with pandoc, a universal document parser, which means that if you provide the document name to pandoc command and ask pandoc to convert the document to other formats, it will do so for you. For example, you can write in org and then ask pandoc to convert the document from org to markdown and then use the markdown document to be exported further. Or, you can write the document in org  mode and then use pandoc to convert the document to latex and then use something like overleaf to convert the document to latex and pdf and use it that way. Or you can transform the document to word and then further process it.

  In this tutorial, my aim is to write the simplest workflow that we can use to work with emacs and org-mode to write data-driven documents that can be converted to a number of different formats. A popular format is to write in jupyter notebooks.

* Mechanics of content authoring in orgmode
  
** Adding headers and converting different types of headers
   You add header levels by adding an asterisk at the beginning of a line. The number of asterisks will determine the level of headers you want to insert. A second level header will be nested within a first level header. I usually do not use more than two levels of headers and that seems to work well for me. YMMV.
   By default, orgmode does not number the headers.
   Suppose you have written a large document or you are writing a large document and you want to jump from one header to another. You do C-c C-n which is the next heading. Or C-c C-p to jump to the previous heading or if you want to jump  one level up, then you do C-c C-u. If you do C-c C-j, then emacs will ask you to move the cursor to a particular header and then hit enter and the header with it content will open up. This is referred to as drawer in org-mode.

** How to add headers
   If you do M-RET or press the alt key and enter, then it will insert a header at the same level next to the header in which you are working. But if you want to insert a new header BEFORE, then you will take the cursor to the beginning of the header and then hit M-RET and it will insert a new header of the same level but above the current header. Same thing if you do C-RET, that is hit control an enter at the same time.
   If you want to convert a second level header to a first level header, you do M-S-LEFT that is alt key plus shift key plus left key. Likewise, if you want to convert a second level header to a third level header, you do M-S-->
   If you want to move your headers up and down, then do M-up or M-down. This will move the header and the associated content up or down depending on what you did.
   

** Cutting and pasting
   There is no concept of selecting a chunk of text and then cutting or pasting. Pasting in Emacs world is referred to as "yanking" and therefore the symbol is y. Cutting and copying are two different things. In copying you copy the content in the header with C-c C-x M-w, this will leave the text as is and then copy it to something called a "kill ring". On the other hand, if you want to cut the text, you do C-c C-x C-w and it will 'cut' the text and place it in the kill ring. Then, wherever you want, you do C-c C-x C-y. 
   
   
** What if you want a line to be converted to a heading?
   Place the cursor in the beginning and hit M-RET. Basically, wherever you want the heading to begin, place the cursor there and hit M-RET and it will insert the heading in the same level. The same effect if you write a single line and hit C-c * and it will create a subheading. So same level heading is M-RET, subheading is C-c* 

*** This line was converted to a header by c-c star

I was a headline once, C-c * turned me to a simple line

**** These are lines
**** This is a second line
**** All these were turned into headers by c-c* by selecting them first of course   
   
** What if you want a line to be converted to a heading?
   Place the cursor in the beginning and hit M-RET. Basically, wherever you want the heading to begin, place the cursor there and hit M-RET and it will insert the heading in the same level. 
   
*** Visibility cycling
    using tab and shift-tab, the headers can be cycled to be visible. So, if you hit tab next to a header, that header will be shown and the document will fold up. If that header contains any text associated with it or nested headers, then you will see an ellipsis in the form of three dots to the left of this header. This is ONLY going to work if you place your cursor next to a header, it is not going to work in a paragraph like where you are reading it.
    So the way it works is something like as follows. You place the cursor next to the header and then hit tab key. The header only shows and the content of the header (known as tree) hides itself. Then you hit tab again and the header with the content shows up. This is useful when you are editing a large document where you do not want to be distracted with too many headers and you only want to work on some part of the document, not all of it. This works like a toggle button.

** Concept of a sparse tree
   So let's say we are working on a large document and I just want to work on this particular segment where I am fully immersed. I do not want to see anythiing else. Sparse tree will enable that. To enable that, use C-c /
   
** Writing paragraphs
** Copying and pasting or cutting and pasting    
  
** Writing lists
   Start with a dash sign, so

   - first item
   - [ ] this checkbox was inserted with M-S-RET
     1. test
     2. test 2 this was done with first typing 1. then M-RET
     3. and this with M-RET and so on
   - third item was place ABOVE second item with M-up
   - second item
     - third item again was indented
   - then unindentted with 
     - with M--> indented again
     - and M-RET inserted this in the same level
*** I was a list item once, C-c * turned me to a header

    - First item
    - Second item
    - Third item

 the following is an unsorted list

 - Fifth item
 - First item
 - Third item
But doing a C-c ^ sorted them to an alphabetically sorted lis

   And then to get out of the list, hit RET twice
     
** Concept of Blocks
   HashPlusBEGIN and HashPlusEND begins and closes blocks.Usually used for codes etc.

** Tables
   - Start with a | symbol to begin a table
   - Start a table with C-c |
   - Then use | as a column separator
   - Then use |- as a horizontal line
   - This will turn the first row a header row
   - Put cell contents between | and |
   - Realign table with RET or TAB or C-c C-c
   - Within the table, TAB moves to next cell
   - Within the table RET moves to next row
   - Put the cursor outside the table and RET to end the table
     

     | Exposure    | Cases | Controls |
     |-------------+-------+----------|
     | Exposed     |   120 |       20 |
     | Non-exposed |    60 |      100 |
     | Total       |   180 |      120 |
    

** How to edit tables

   | What to do                             | Instructions |
   |----------------------------------------+--------------|
   | Sort table                             | C-c^         |
   | Move between columns                   | M-a or M-e   |
   | Move row down                          | M-DN         |
   | Move current columnn to left or right  | M--> or M-<- |
   | Insert new column to the left          | M-S-->       |
   | Delete column                          | M-S-<-       |
   | Insert row above the current           | M-S-DN       |
   | Move row up                            | M-UP         |
   | Delete Row                             | M-S-UP       |
   | Insert horizontal line                 | c-c -        |
   | Insert horizontal line and move cursor | C-c RET      |

** Other miscellaneous things with tables

   | What do you want to do          | Instructions                           |
   |---------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
   | Copy table region               | C-c C-x M-w                            |
   | Cut table region                | C-c C-x C-w                            |
   | Paste region                    | C-c C-x C-y                            |
   | Split table                     | M-RET                                  |
   | Sum numbers                     | C-c + then C-y                         |
   | Copy Down                       | S-RET                                  |
   | Edit in separate window         | C-c ` and finish with C-c C-c          |
   | Import tab separated table      | M-x org-table-import                   |
   | Convert a region into table     | Select then C-c                        |
   | Export Table                    | M-x org-table-export                   |
   | For long tables, display header | M-x org-table-header-line-mode         |
   | Transpose Table                 | M-x org-table-transpose-table-at-point |
   
** Convert a region to table
   1. First type space separated data in a region
   2. Select the region
   3. Type C-c |

 The following table was drawn on the basis of the above notes     

| Student | test_results |
| Tess    |          100 |
| Kim     |          200 |

** Transpposition of a time dependent table e.g.
   1. Write a space separated table
   2. Then put the cursor in first row first column
   3. Type M-x org-table-transpose-table-at-point

 The following table was produced with the above steps
#+NAME: longtable
| Individual | xxx | yyy |
| Score_t1   | 100 |  99 |
| Score_t2   | 120 |  98 |
| Score_t3   | 130 |  49 |

The org table mode can be turned on with M-x orgtbl-mode

** Using the table as a spreadsheet

   The table can be used as a spreadsheet. In order to do so, it is useful to use the concepts of references. Take the following table

| Exposure    | Cases | Controls | Total |
| Exposed     |   120 |       40 |   160 |
| Non-exposed |    40 |       80 |   120 |
| Total       |   160 |      120 |   280 |
#+TBLFM: @4$2 = @2$2 + @3$2
#+TBLFM: @4$3 = @2$3 + @3$3
#+TBLFM: $4 = $2 + $3

Let's say we want to work on this as a table

 + If you want to turn on/off grid display, do C-c } 
 + If you want to find out coordinate of a grid, C-c ?
 + You can find the reference of a cell with C-c ?
 + Rule is: @ROW$COLUMN
 + @0$0 refers to the current cell
 + @2 implies second row of current column
 + $1 implies first column of the current row
 + Ranges are indicated with beginning .. end
 + The beginning and ends are INCLUDED
 + $1..$3 means the row elements of first, second, and third columns
 + Otherwise, indicate the row with @ symbol, so
 + $1..@2$3 would mean from the first column to second row of third column
 + These range references return a VECTOR of values
 + Feed them into vector functions
 + If you want to reference another table, set a name to it, by:
 + #+NAME: Name of the table
 + After writing the formula below the table with:
 + #+TBLFM: <expression>, place cursor on the line and
 + Do, C-c C-c
 + You can write more than one formulae
 + If you do so, place the cursor next to each line and do C-c C-c

** Writing the formula
   - A formula can be any algebraic expression
   - Example: vsum(@2..@3) will calculate the vertical sum
   - Use #+TBLFM: write the formula
     
** How to insert hyperlinks to a document
Let's say we want to place a link to an external resource such as Medium or Curvenote. We will write like this:
 + [[https://medium.com/@arinbasu][Medium Arin's page]]
 + Org will turn the link to a blue hyperlink
 + [[https://www.curvenote.com]]
 + Org will turn the page to a blue hyperlink for Curvenote
 + But this time it leaves the URL as is as we did not provide a description
 + For internal links, we can do similar things with:
   + A section with [[Concept of drawers]]
   + Write the header between two squared brackets
   + Otherwise, for tables, do something like #+NAME: somename and then
   + Add the somename between the square brackets, so
   + [[longtable]] will lead to the long table
   + You can also insert link with C-c C-l, so
   + [[https://www.nixos.org][NixOs webpage]] was inserted with this keystroke
     

** Concept of drawers
   Hiding information so use
   ::Draw1::
   Then write something and then
   ::END::
   ends the drawer

** Orgmode as productivity tool
  Orgmode can be used to store ideas and productivity stuff while writing, includng todo items and logging processes.
  * Create a to do item with headline with TODO keyword, or
  * C-c C-t
  * The following todo item was created that way
  * Rotate between TODO, DONE, and Plain header with C-c C-t
  * Or, do S--> or S-<- shift right or left
  * Once you have done that, and entered a few stuff, then
  * Use C-c / to use it as a sparse tree (see [[Concept of a sparse tree]] )
  * Add a new todo entry below the present one with S-M-RET
  * The sparse tree will show the todo items, not the done ones
  * We can add something like INPROCESS before DONE, so we modify
  * the ~/.emacs.d/init.el file with
  * (setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO" "INPROCESS" "|" "DONE")))
  * Then exit Emacs and restart and revisit an org file
  * How to set up dependencies for todo items
    * This means, you list what items must be completed before
    * Another item can be marked as done
    * and so on
  * Record timestamp and note when change a todo state
    * C-u C-c C-t then C-c C-c
    * This is a good practice as this forces you to recognise
    * What you did with it!
  * Prioritise tasks with #A #B #C where A = highest priority

** How to use tags in orgmode                     :learning:tutorial:editing:

   + Headline can have tags at the end of the headline
   + Tags are added with :tagword:
   + Two or more tags are written as :tag1:tag2:
   + Tags have same colour as headlines
   + Subheadings i.e., heading level 2 from heading level 1 inherits the tags
   + So in the following example, "Adding images ..." has tag learning
   + Adding images also has two subheadings "Adding images from files" and
     "Adding images from websites"
   + Adding images from websites does not have a separate tag but it can be said that this one has inherited the learning tag
   + You can specify tags for files so in the preamble, do
   + #+FILETAGS: :learning:tutorial:
   + See, same as tags for headings
   + Tags are searchable
     + Search tags with C-c / m
   + How to set tags:
     + After headline, colon tagword colon
     + C-c C-q
     + C-c C-c works ony when you are in a headline
     + In the preamble of your document with #+TAGS: keyword
 
** What are properties?                                            :learning:
 You can assign properties to headlines or agenda items using a [[Drawers]] where the drawer name is PROPERTIES between colons and assign attributes and values or keys and values. So for example an article can be assigned properties such as title, author, year as follows

 *** Article Collection
 :PROPERTIES:
 :title: A summary of how to use orgmode
 :author: AB
 :year: 2021
 :END:

 If you have entered properties anywhere in the document, you can search for them using the C-c / m and specifying the name of the property that you created. As with the tags, properties can be inherited.

** Using orgmode for universal idea capture               :productivity:uses:

   + First, define a directory where you will keep notes
   + (setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))
   + Write the above in ~/.emacs.d/init.el file
   + So, notes.org is the directory where I am going to store my notes
   + Hit M-x org-capture
   + Select a template, for the first time it will show t for todo
   + Write something and then hit C-c C-c
   + When you do it for the first time, it will ask you to create org folder, say yes
   + It will create /home/arin/org directory and will place a notes.org in it
   + We often want to capture more than todo items, for this, create a template
   + Template (setq org-capture-templates
             '(("j" "Journal" entry (file_datetree "~/org/journal.org")
                "* %\?\nEntered on %U\n %i\n %a")))

   
** How to write rich text documents in orgmode?

*** Writing paragraphs
+ At least one empty line separate paragraphs
+ Use blocks [[Blocks]] to insert special elements such as VERSE and QUOTE
+ *Bold* is like this, /italic/ is like this, and _underlined_
+ =verbatim= and ~code~
+ +strikethrough+
+ Superscript: x^2
+ Subscript x_1
+ Toggle them with C-c C-x \
+ Symbols, say alpha is \alpha (view with C-c C-x \)
+ For equations, set #+OPTIONS: tex: t then
+ for single line equations, $a^2=b$ and for multiline equations,
+ \begin{equation} ... equation ... \end{equation}
+ Preview with #+STARTUP: latexpreview and then C-c C-x C-l
+ Horizontal rules are with five dashes
+ Footnotes are given as =[fn:1]= and then =[fn:1] Description=
+ View footnotes with C-c C-x f

-----

** Adding images to orgmode document
Do the following, so:
+ Write a caption of the image
+ Give the image a name
+ Insert the image with =[[image url]]=
+ then view it inline with C-c C-x C-v and toggle the view

#+CAPTION: An image
#+NAME: somefigure

[[./somepic.jpg]]

Then view it with C-c C-x C-v

** Adding citations
+ Before adding citations, prepare a bibtex file
+ Say the bibtex file is named =test.bib=
+ Add it to the preamble with =#+bibliography: test.bib= in the block
+ Wherever you want to insert, type M-x org-cite-insert then type the first letter of the citation key or something
+ Then hit tab key
+ It will show the matched name, accept it with RET RET
+ Or manually with =[cite: @citation_id]=
+ Make sure you have orgmode version 9.5 or above
+ find out with M-x org-version

Egger wrote [cite:@Egger1997-wq]


** Adding and evaluating  codes

+ Codes can be added with blocks [[Blocks]]
+ Codes can also be evaluated that way

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  this is a test
#+END_EXAMPLE

But that was a trivial example. We will show two examples; one for R and the other for python.

*** What to do

+ Start a block with =#+begin_src R (or Python) ... #+end_src=
+ Write your code
+ Place cursor witin the code block
+ C-c C-c

*** Here is an example with R  

#+begin_src R

  x <- 2
  y <- 8
  
  print(x * y)

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
